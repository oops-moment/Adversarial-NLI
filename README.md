# README

This repository contains two main folders, each dedicated to different aspects of the project:

1. **Baseline**: Implements a standard model to achieve baseline results.
2. **InfoBERT**: Implements the InfoBERT regularizer for enhanced results.

## Folder Structure

### Baseline
The `baseline` folder contains:
- **Model Implementation**: Core model scripts for obtaining baseline results.
- **Scripts**: Python files that, when executed, produce baseline performance metrics.

### InfoBERT
The `inforbert` folder contains:
- **InfoBERT Implementation**: Scripts to apply the InfoBERT regularizer to the model.
- **Scripts**: Python files to run and evaluate the model with InfoBERT regularization.

## How to Run

Each folder includes a `scripts` directory with Python files to generate the desired results.

### Note

The links to the final trained models have been provided in the report.

### Steps to Run:
1. Navigate to the respective folder (`baseline` or `inforbert`).
2. Locate the `scripts` folder within it.
3. Run the relevant Python file using:
   bash
   python <script_name>.py``
